# ble_lightbulb - ported to the current version of Nordic SDK (15.2.0)

Code to the great tutorial about nRF52 BLE Peripheral application by Mohammad Afaneh (https://www.novelbits.io/). 

The code has been updated to the current version of the Nordic SDK (15.2.0).

The code doesn't have cleaning which was described in the tutorial. I will do it in the next few days in a separate branch.

The code compiles well and works perfectly on nRF52840-Dk board.
